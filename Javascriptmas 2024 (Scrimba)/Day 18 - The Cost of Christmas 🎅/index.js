ðŸ˜± Christmas can get expensive! 

You've been on a shopping trip and spent too much money. 
But how much of that can you blame on Christmas?

**Task**

- Calculate and return the total cost of only the gifts in the shopping cart.
- Each gift has the isGift boolean set to true.
- The total cost of gifts should be given to two decimal places.

Expected output: 559.93  

**Stretch Goal**

- Use the reduce() method to complete this challenge.

    const array = arr.filter(({ isGift }) => isGift);

    const sum = array.reduce((acc, { price }) => acc + price, 0);

    return sum;

console.log(calculateCost(shoppingCartData)); //559.93
